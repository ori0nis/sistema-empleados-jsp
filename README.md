## Welcome to Sistema Empleados, a Jakarta Server Pages web app! ðŸš€

Sistema de Empleados is a simple management system where you can add, modify or delete employees that are allocated in a SQL database. The frontend uses JSP and JSTL tags to produce dynamic code, and it was styled using Bootstrap. 

The database is managed with Springboot, JPA and Hibernate.

This app was created following Ubaldo Acosta's lead during his "Universidad Java" masterclass.
